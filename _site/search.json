    "section": "Application Advice for Students",
    "text": "Application Advice for Students\n\nOverall, mentors look for:\n\nInterest in their specific project and eagerness to learn about their topic. Do some research into the mentor’s topic, organization, or research agenda in addition to the project description they provide.\nA good fit between your current skillset and the kind of training they’re looking to provide (e.g., domain knowledge vs. technical methods).\nConcise, concrete examples that demonstrate (not just name) your skills and experience.\nTeam players who are willing to do some tedious work.\n\n\n\nFor a compelling written application:\n\nExpress what interests you about this project specifically.\nDon’t cut and paste from one response to the next without editing and verifying that everything applies.\nKeep responses brief and concise. Include only information that the person leading the specific project would be interested in.\nDon’t submit applications written by generative AI.\nTake the time to customize your short answer questions for each project. (Your profile will be repeated across applications.)\n\n\n\nDuring the interview:\n\nBe succinct and provide concrete examples with your responses.\nTry to include examples outside of class projects or assignments.\nInterviews are also used for fact checking: You should be able to back up what you said on paper.\nAsk good questions about the topic of the project.\n\n\n\nSkills mentors look for:\n\n“Soft skills” like collaboration, perseverance, and flexibility can be even more important than technical skills. Provide specific examples of how you’ve embodied these skills–just including them on your resume doesn’t actually say a lot.\nBeing able to demonstrate times you’ve worked on a team is especially useful.\nMany mentors are eager to fill you in on their domain or subject, but expect you to come in with a solid grasp of the tools.\n\n\n\nThings to know before applying to Data Discovery and choosing a project:\n\nYour commitment to the project is for the duration of the program. Be realistic about your other commitments this semester. You’re committing to your mentor, your teammates, and to the Data Discovery program and must maintain these responsibilities.\nWorking with real-world data involves tedious tasks. Do not apply if you aren’t prepared to grind.\nBe prepared to work as a member of a team. Not everyone will be the leader or the star.\nNot all tasks are glamorous, and you may not end the project with a flashy or innovative finding. Research can be a slow, iterative process. Your contributions to the project will still be valuable, and this authentic experience will teach you a lot about how research gets done.\n\n\n\nCareer Engagement Resources\n\nPreparing for interviews: https://career.berkeley.edu/prepare-for-success/interviewing/interview-preparation/\nBig Interview: https://berkeley.biginterview.com/\nWriting a resume: https://career.berkeley.edu/prepare-for-success/resumes/"
