The Data Discovery Program connects undergraduates with hands-on, team-based opportunities in cutting-edge research projects at UC Berkeley, government agencies, community groups, and entrepreneurial ventures.

## For Student Researchers

Student Researchers can apply to projects of their interest and work in teams throughout the semester on a research or social impact project under the guidance of a project mentor. Student Researchers earn academic units as they complete their project with their team. Discovery offers workshops throughout the semester to support students on their projects.

## For Research Partners

Discovery is dedicated to providing top-notch data science, computer science, and statistics capacity to our project partners while also fostering a unique learning environment for our students. Project partners should design projects so that a team of students can be engaged over the course of a single or multiple semesters (a semester is about 12 weeks of work). Projects should include a strong data component, and a dataset must be available by the start of the semester. Project partners can oversee multiple projects.
