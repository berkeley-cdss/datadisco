  section_title: "About Data Discovery"
  description: >
    The Data Discovery Program connects teams of Berkeley students with mentors
    across campus and beyond, using data to understand real-world problems in
    academia, industry, government and nonprofits.
    The Symposium is the culmination of the semester as student researchers share
    their work through poster presentations. Please join us in celebrating their
    contributions to the data research community.

acknowledgments: >
  We would like to thank everyone who’s contributed to the College of Computing,
  Data Science, and Society’s Data Discovery program and making the Symposium come
  to life. Data Discovery would not be possible without the leadership of
  Professor Deb Nolan. Sierra J. White-Koutsoubos and Associate Dean of Students
  Professor Narges Norouzi have provided invaluable guidance. Jessica McDaniels
  arranged crucial details of the event, and Camille Simsuangco Roxas helped
  execute it. CDSS Development contributed funds for the Symposium. Claire Chen,
  Keryssa Li and Leo Liao have helped keep Data Discovery running smoothly this
  semester. Ryan Lovett helped arrange access to computing resources and provided
  technical support, and we acknowledge the National Science Foundation’s National
  Artificial Intelligence Research Resource Pilot for providing computational
  resources (award number NAIRR240387). Thank you to the experts who shared their
  time and expertise through guest lectures and panels for the Data Discovery
  course. Finally, we’d like to thank the Data Discovery mentors who provide the
  projects and mentorship that make the program possible.
