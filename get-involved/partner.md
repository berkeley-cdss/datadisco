## Program Overview

Since 2015, the **Data Discovery Program** has helped incubate and accelerate research for over 1,000 partner projects. We do this by connecting projects with talented student teams along with project management and technical infrastructure support. 

We welcome all academic institutions, non-profits, government agencies, and industry to partner with us.
