title: "For Student Researchers"
---

## Overview
As a Data Discovery student researcher, you'll work on a team with a project mentor, using data to understand real-world problems. Through the associated Data Discovery course, you'll earn course credit for your work on the project and develop professional skills to support your progress.

## Timeline
Exact program deadlines vary by semester. Typically, Data Discovery applications open to students about 2 weeks before instruction begins. For the most competitive application, apply by the priority deadline, about 1 week before classes start. The application closes during the first week of class. Most project mentors will schedule an interview before making an offer. You can add yourself to the Data Discovery course waitlist once you've scheduled an interview. If you accept an offer, you'll be moved from the waitlist and admitted to the course. Work on the project will end during the last week of class, with a final presentation during RRR week.
