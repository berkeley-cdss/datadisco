title: "For Student Researchers"
---

## Overview
As a Data Discovery student researcher, you'll work on a team with a project mentor, using data to understand real-world problems. Through the associated Data Discovery course, you'll earn course credit for your work on the project and develop professional skills to support your progress.

## Timeline
Exact program deadlines vary by semester. Typically, Data Discovery applications open to students about 2 weeks before instruction begins. For the most competitive application, apply by the priority deadline, about 1 week before classes start. The application closes during the first week of class. Most project mentors will schedule an interview before making an offer. You can add yourself to the Data Discovery course waitlist once you've scheduled an interview. If you accept an offer, you'll be moved from the waitlist and admitted to the course. Work on the project will end during the last week of class, with a final presentation during RRR week.


## Application
- **Max applications:** You may apply for up to 10 projects (you may participate in only one).
- **Application questions:** You'll be asked to answer these three questions in your application:
  1. Please describe your relevant core skills, additional skills, and any experience with the topics listed for this project (50-150 words).* Include the context (e.g., coursework, internship, or personal project). 
  2. What experiences do you bring that would help make this Data Discovery project successful? Consider including examples of times you showed leadership, resourcefulness, or the ability to work independently (max 250 words)*.
  3. What do you wish to gain through participating in this project? Your response should address why you’ve chosen this project in particular (max 250 words)*.

## Application Advice for Students

### What Mentors Look For
Overall, mentors look for students who demonstrate:

- **Interest in the specific project** and a genuine eagerness to learn about the topic. Take time to research the mentor’s work, organization, or research agenda beyond the provided project description.
- **A strong fit between your current skillset and the training the mentor aims to provide**, whether that involves domain knowledge, technical methods, or both.
- **Concise and concrete examples** that demonstrate your skills and experience, rather than simply naming them.
- **A collaborative mindset**, including willingness to contribute to tedious or repetitive tasks when needed.



### For a Compelling Written Application
To strengthen your written responses:

- Clearly express **why this particular project interests you**.
- Avoid copying and pasting responses across applications without carefully editing to ensure relevance.
- Keep responses **brief, focused, and directly relevant** to the project lead.
- **Do not submit applications written by generative AI.**
- Take time to **customize your short-answer responses** for each project, even though your profile information will repeat across applications.



### During the Interview
When interviewing with mentors:

- Be succinct and support your answers with **specific, concrete examples**.
- Include examples from **outside of coursework** when possible.
- Be prepared to **verify and expand on what you wrote in your application**, as interviews often serve as fact checking.
- Ask thoughtful questions about the project’s goals, data, and subject area.



### Skills Mentors Value
Mentors often prioritize:

- **Soft skills** such as collaboration, perseverance, flexibility, and reliability, sometimes even more than technical skills.
- Demonstrated experience **working effectively in teams**, supported by specific examples.
- A willingness to learn new domains, paired with a **solid foundational understanding of relevant tools and methods**.

Simply listing skills on a resume is not sufficient. Mentors want to see how you have applied them in practice.



### Things to Know Before Applying
Before applying to Data Discovery and choosing a project:

- Your commitment lasts **for the full duration of the program**. Be realistic about your other responsibilities, as you are committing to your mentor, teammates, and the program.
- Working with real-world data often involves **tedious and time-consuming tasks**. Do not apply if you are not prepared for this type of work.
- Be ready to contribute as a **member of a team**. Not everyone will be the leader or work on the most visible tasks.
- Research is often **slow and iterative**, and results may not be flashy or innovative. Even so, your contributions are valuable and provide authentic insight into how research is conducted.
