# CDSS Data Discovery Fall 2025 Symposium

## About Data Discovery
The Data Discovery Program connects teams of Berkeley students with mentors across campus and beyond, using data to understand real-world problems in academia, industry, government and nonprofits.

The Symposium is the culmination of the semester as student researchers share their work through poster presentations. Please join us in celebrating their contributions to the data research community.

You can visit our webpage at https://cdss.berkeley.edu/discovery or email us at cdss-datadiscovery@berkeley.edu.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to thank everyone who’s contributed to the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society’s Data Discovery program and making the Symposium come to life. Data Discovery would not be possible without the leadership of Professor Deb Nolan. Sierra J. White-Koutsoubos and Associate Dean of Students Professor Narges Norouzi have provided invaluable guidance. Jessica McDaniels arranged crucial details of the event, and Camille Simsuangco Roxas helped execute it. CDSS Development contributed funds for the Symposium. Claire Chen, Keryssa Li and Leo Liao have helped keep Data Discovery running smoothly this semester. Ryan Lovett helped arrange access to computing resources and provided technical support, and we acknowledge the National Science Foundation’s National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource Pilot for providing computational resources (award number NAIRR240387). Thank you to the experts who shared their time and expertise through guest lectures and panels for the Data Discovery course. Finally, we’d like to thank the Data Discovery mentors who provide the projects and mentorship that make the program possible.
